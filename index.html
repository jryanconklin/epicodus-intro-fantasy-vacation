        <h5>School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h5>
        <p>
          Congratulations, you're clearly a Witch or Wizard. A ton has changed since the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998! Hogwarts remains one of the best made-up schools in the world. It's certainly better than the rumors coming off the set of the upcoming Harry Potter movie prequel for what American wizarding schools are. Anyway, congratulations. Frankly, I'm a little jealous.

        <p>
          Personally, I'm a Babylon 5 guy. I mean, that show is incredibly cheesy. But whatever. You're a space person and you have space needs. You live in the Federation, which is an awful lot like sci-fi Bernie Sanders utopia. Which is pretty cool. Don't ask me why you're going to DS9 over Risa. Anyway, have fun!

        <h4>It's a Staycation in the Shire!</h4>
        <h5>Home of Hobbits and NO ADVENTURE</h5>
        <p>
          It's home to a lot of the small-folk of Middle-Earth. No, not the ones referenced in Game of Thrones. That's totally a different writer with RR as his middle initials. Literally the small-folk. Hobbits. Little guys with hairy feet. Anyway, you're one of them maybe so this is your home. There's a lot to do here! Fishing! Gardening! Your beer doesn't come in pints, so that's nice for moderation. Flip side to this is that no one is going to toss The One Ring into Mount Doom. But that's someone else's problem, right?

        <h4>You're Going to Mordor!</h4>
        <h5>Take Samwise, Trust Me</h5>
        <p>
          One does not simply vacation in Mordor, except maybe you! There's so much to do in the scenic desolation of the Dark Lord's heartland: Get to know the locals by impersonating them for your own safety! Climb to the top of Mount Doom! Struggle with the unbearable weight of your destiny to do the near impossible! Except that Samwise is going to do all the hard stuff for you, so that's cool.
